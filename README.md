# Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project utilizes a TensorFlow model to recognize handwritten digits from images. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9).

## Features

- **Model Training**: Train a neural network on the MNIST dataset to learn and recognize handwritten digits.
- **Model Persistence**: Save the trained model to disk for future use.
- **Prediction**: Load the trained model and make predictions on new input images.
- **Visualization**: Preview input images along with their predicted digit labels.

## Project Structure

- **Training Script**: A script to train the neural network and save the model.
- **Prediction Script**: A script to load the saved model and predict digits from new images.
- **Utility Functions**: Code for loading images, preprocessing, and visualization.

## How It Works

1. **Model Training**: The neural network is trained on the MNIST dataset to recognize digits.
2. **Model Saving**: After training, the model is saved to a file.
3. **Model Loading and Prediction**: The saved model is loaded to make predictions on new images.

## Usage

Load your own images to get predictions and visualize the results. This project helps in understanding how machine learning can be applied to image recognition tasks.
